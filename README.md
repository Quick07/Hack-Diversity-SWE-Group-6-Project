# How It's Made :nut_and_bolt: :hammer::wrench::
 This application built with React.js, Express, Node, Webpack, Morgan, CORS & Cookie-Parser.

# How It's Works:white_check_mark::ðŸ–¥ 
 
Your final application does not need to follow the same design, but should be similar in terms of functionality and user experience (e.g., Home page that shows all exams, clicking on an exam will show its details, admin page to add new exams or remove existing ones, etc.).

:arrow_forward: ::construction:	  Create the frontend with fake data


:arrow_forward: ::construction:	 Connect the frontend to our backend and render real data


:arrow_forward: ::construction:	 Write your own backend and connect it to your frontend Deployment


:arrow_forward: ::construction:	 In order to support the building of this application, youâ€™ll need to work on several different tasks. Some of these can be done in parallel, meaning multiple people can work on them at once.

:vertical_traffic_light:	 In the first step:

 :bangbang:	Set up your code repository, using the skeleton we have provided for you.

 :bangbang:	Create all three pages noted above â€“ you can work on these all separately.

:vertical_traffic_light:	In the second step:

 :bangbang:	Add interaction with our API; each page can also be done separately.

:vertical_traffic_light:	In the third and fourth steps:

 :bangbang:	Creating the data models and building their endpoints can also be done in parallel.

:vertical_traffic_light:	This skeleton contains two different applications 

 :bangbang:	-- a front end, or "client," created with "Create React App," and a back end, or "API," created with Express. 

:mortar_board:: In order to make both of them work together:

 :bangbang: you'll need to run both, but you can run just one or the other to start. As you begin working on this project, you'll first focus on the client, so you can more or less ignore the API portion of the code for now.

## Client :triangular_flag_on_post:	
:white_check_mark:	In order to run the client, you'll run the following commands:

```bash
cd client/
npm i
npm start
```

You should then be able to visit `localchost:3000` in your browser and see the client running. If you make changes in the `App.js` file, you should see them reflected.

## API :triangular_flag_on_post:	
 :white_check_mark:	 In order to run the server, you'll run the following commands:

```bash
cd api/
npm i
npm start
```

# Demo :video_game:

You should then be able to visit `localhost:9000` in your browser and see the server running.
